## ‚ùì FAQ
### Q: How can I render a scene?
* A: To render a scene in Blender, you must have an active camera (a camera properly setup) in your scene. Then, go to the top left corner, and click "Render" > "Render Image" or "Render Video" depending on what you are creating.

### Q: How can I put eyes, patterns, and badges on the Drifter IK Rig?
* A: In the .zip file you downloaded with the Drifter IK Rig, there should be a folder containing all the patterns and eyes. Don't see a pattern? Please make a new issue in the "Issues" tab. Once you have your eye, pattern, and badge selected, go into the "Shading" tab of the Drifter IK Rig, then open each Image Texture, and import your eye, pattern, and badge.
